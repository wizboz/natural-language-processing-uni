        "Natural Language Processing is a field of computer science or computational linguistics that focuses the algorithmic manipulation of natural language via computers (Bird, Klien and Loper, 2009). Computers do not operate in natural language, instead computers use machine code to interpret instructions. Machine code is a binary numerical language, consisting of 1s and 0s. When we write computer programs we must use a high-level language such as Python or Java to write source code which can be compiled and translated to machine code. Similarly, natural language processing (NLP) works to interpret human language in a way that computers, who only operate in machine language, can comprehend. \n",
        "The aim of NLP is to manipulate natural language using high-level programming languages that can be understood by computers, so that human language can be more effectively intergrated into certain technologies and applications. \n",
        "\n",
        "NLP applications are commonplace today being used in search engines, all kinds of text analysis such as style or summarisations,as well as being vital in human-computer interaction.  Common NLP fields are question answering and information extraction, chatbots and dialogue systems, automatic speech recognition/text to speech and machine translation (Jurafsky and Martin, 2023). \n",
        "\n",
        "NLP allows us to automatically analyse or classify texts according to sentiment, topic etc, which can be useful for marketing purposes as well as gathering information. Furthermore, question answer and information extraction are important tasks that enable computers to retrieve information. Information extraction can be achieved through mining of web data or by performing a reading comprehension on raw texts. These algorithms are able to identify patterns and keywords in the data. A prominent benefactor of these systems are search engines which collect and rank documents in order to show the most relevant results to a natural language query (Jurafsky and Martin, 2023). However, question answering, especially long form question answering, is also incorporated into conversational agents (Jurafsky and Martin, 2023). \n",
        "\n",
        "Following from this, within the field of human-computer interaction NLP is commonly used in dialogue systems. This usually takes the form of task-based personal assistants, such as 'Siri' or 'Alexa', that can perform tasks via written or, more often, spoken language. There are numerous sub-applications of NLP concerning speech - text-to-speech software can be used by those who cannot speak themselves or wish to automatically generate a voice that is not their own, transcribing software can assist with human dictation and speech detection can be used to extract information from audio - to name a few examples. Chatbots are also a popular use of NLP. These chatbots are trained to be able to respond and generate relevant (and informed) natural language. These applications began using rule-based methods, eg. *ELIZA*, but the field is now dominated by neural networks and transformer based models, eg. *ChatGPT* (Jurafsky and Martin, 2023). \n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, machine translation involves using computers to translate one language to another, such as the methods used by popular applications like *Google Translate*. It is often used whilst browsing web data but also can be a helpful tool for human translators (Jurafsky and Martin, 2023). It most often functions by using an encoder-decoder network trained on already translated data in both languages, which is able to map an input sequence and its contextual information to an output sequence. These sequence-to-sequence based models excel at modelling the complex lingustical variations between the same sequence in two languages (Jurafsky and Martin, 2023). Machine translation can also be helpful in question answering as natural language queries can also be translated to a high-order logical representations and used to index a vast database of knowledge for knowledge retrieval (Jurafsky and Martin, 2023).\n",
        "\n",
        "Overall NLP enables computers to interpret human natural language. Since, computers play a major role in our everyday lives, natural language processing systems are essential to operate freely in an increasingly technological world.\n"

        "In nearly all natural languages there is some level of ambiguity that can cause problems for NLP applications. Since we are working today with English, I will discuss ambiguity the English language. Ambiguity in English is often caused by homonyms. Homonyms come in two forms - homophones and homographs.  \n",
        "\n",
        "Homophones are words that are pronounced the same but have different meanings (and often spellings also). Consider the following sentences: \n",
        "\n",
        "*   I put a **lead** on the dog.\n",
        "*   He **lead** them astray.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Her favourite color is **blue**.\n",
        "*   The wind **blew** it away.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, the words 'lead' and 'lead' as well as 'blue' and 'blew' have the same pronounciation but mean different things. Hearing the word alone is not enough to determine which meaning is meant. Whilst, sometimes the spelling of the word can differentiate the meaning as we can see with 'blue' and 'blew', usually the context is required for the meaning to be understood. This can create an issue for NLP speech recognition applications as more information other than the single word is needed to determine which word is being spoken. Hence, the application cannot approach the input one word at a time, it must consider series of words in order to interpret the context and attribute the appropriate meaning. \n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly, homographs are words that are spelt the same but have different meanings (and are often pronounced differently as well). An example of this is '**read**' (present tense) and '**read**' (past tense). These words often need pronounciations or contextual information from the whole sentence to be properly understood by machines or humans. NLP algorithms will struggle to distinguish these words from each other, as words with the same spelling will be considered the same 'word' if words are counted. For example, although word tagging can help mitigate this, a simple model that generates the next word in a sentence could generate the phrase 'a present this' because both 'a present' and 'present this' occur frequently together. However, the term in the first sentence refers to the noun *present* and the term in the verb *to present*, but both meanings are being 'lumped together' into one term. Hence, the resuling sentence is grammatically incorrect. \n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, certain words are both homophones and homographs. Consider:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Go**!\n",
        "\n",
        "Are they ordering someone to leave or cheering them on?\n",
        "\n",
        "*   I made her **duck**.\n",
        "\n",
        "Did she bend down to avoid an overhead object, eating water-fowl that has been prepared for her or some other meaning? \n",
        "\n",
        "These are full sentences, but even further context is required to determine their meaning. Further context can include the setting, previous sentences or even the tone or emotion of the speaker. Pronouns, emphasis, sarcasm, abbreviations, word variants and slang can provide further complexities that are problematic for computers. Humans are exeptionally good at understanding the complexities of natural language, although some still struggle - machines, however, can only understand natural language according to their given facilities. Capturing these complexities in a framework in a primary goal of NLP work.\n",

For example the sentence, \"Hello, where's my hat? My hat has dissappeared!\" can be seperated into 12 distinct tokens. Each word counts as a token, with hat only appearing in the list of tokens once despite appearing twice. The punctuation, \",\", \".\", \"?\" and \"!\" are also considered tokens. The contraction \"where's\" will be split into two tokens: \"where\" and \"'s\". Spaces, returns or new line characters are not included in the list of tokens.\n",

In NLP the two types of morphenes are 'stems' and 'affixes'. An affix is the ending of the word, such as -ing, -ly, -s, -y. For example, the afix of the word 'beautiful' is 'ful', and the stem is 'beauti'. The stem proceeds the affix and is where you can find the general meaning of the word, whereas the affix denotes an attribute of that meaning. \n",

The stem is not equivalent to the root word, however. Indeed, the stem is not intended to be a word at all (see 'beauti'), merely one part. "

This text can be normalised, cleaned and processes through a series of processing modules such as case-folding and cleaning the data, tokenization, PoS tagging, sentence segmentation and lemmatization/stemming depending on the task. This can be done via a processing pipeline. Next we must vectorize the data - this will present the reviews as a numerical vector that the machine learning algorithm is able to analyse. A model can then be trained on the vectorised data. These can often be constructed using pre-trained libraries such as NLTK.\n",

Stopwords especially contribute to this, as well as punctuation when considering all tokens. Due to our task being word prediction, I have not removed either of these during text normalisation. \n",

        "As each addition was added to the 4-gram model, the perplexity score decreased.A decreasing perplexity score usually indicates model improvements. The initial perplexity score for the original 4-gram model tended to infinity due to the lack of probability smoothing involved during model training - leading to the model 'zero-ing out' when confronted with unknown words or combinations (Jurasfsky and Martin, 2023). We can see that Laplace scoring significantly lowered the perplexity of the model. More sophisticated smoothing algorithms, such as Backoff and Interpolation can be implemented such as and may show further improvements (Jurasfsky and Martin, 2023). Finally, eliminating less frequent tokens helps reduce the sparsity of the dataset, lowering the perplexity even further and allowing the model to make more accurate next-word predicitions. However, further evaluation metrics beyond perplexity as well as more complex text normalisation techniques are still required to determine the best n-gram language model. "

For a sequence of tokens of $n$ length, there will be $n-1$ bigrams, $n-2$ trigrams, $n-3$ 4-grams etc. so for the overall time complexity will be $O(n-k-1)$ where k is the order of n-gram.

Using Zipf's law to replaced underused tokens with <UNK> is one way to optimise efficiency, however, using other classification algorithms, either traditional machine learning algorithms or neural networks can streamline the process significantly.
